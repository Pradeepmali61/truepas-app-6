 *
 * Captured document scans are deliberately KEPT: the backend never returns
 * them, so wiping here made every passport photo vanish after a re-login.
 * They're keyed by server document id (unreachable from another account)
 * and removed on document delete / account delete.
 *
 * The server call never blocks local cleanup — even if /auth/logout fails
 * or no refresh token is readable, the session ends locally.
 * Every logout entry point uses this so the wipe can't drift between screens
 * — including flows where the backend already ended the session (password
 * change): those pass `{ serverRevoked: true }`.
 *
 * `isPending` mirrors the /auth/logout call so buttons can show a spinner.
